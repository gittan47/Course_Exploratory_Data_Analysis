# Course_Exploratory_Data_Analysis
Course assignments
Here is the repository for the Coursera's course "Exploratory Data Analysis" that I made. There are 8 files for the Course Project1:
4 png files and 4 R-scripts to generate each.  
    
To run this you need to do the following:  
 -Download the data from here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip  
 -Extract the data into ./Data subdirectory  
 -Download the scripts (plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R) to some directory;  
 -Run the scripts in R
Everything will be in the working directory
