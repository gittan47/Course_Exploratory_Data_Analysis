I was unable to commit, add or whatever you call it the png files I had created with R
So for this assignment I lost hours and hours on something that wasn't statistical data
science or how to work with R.
I'm very sorry for this. Github is too complicated to use for me. I felt like in the beginning of the data and pc years,
trying to figure out what magic words and numbers must be put where and when. A feeling of frustration and powerlessness that
come back to me. When windows 3.1 came to me I was happy to use drag and drop, copy and paste possibilities and a graphic interface
where you could see what was happening. With clearly visible save and ok buttons etc. Are we going backwards again? And why?
Snobism?, power? or is it really necessary? 
I hope there will be some kind of explanation on how to put imagefiles
into the repository without using for me unknown code or hidden terminals or things like that.So I can focus on the purpose of this course which for me is to learn more about exploratory data analysis and how to do this with R.
TODAY I GOT THE ADVICE TO USE TOURTOISEGIT AND IT WORKED! I'M SO HAPPY AGAIN.
